**Workshop Structure**
| **Level** | **Title** | **Description** | **Key Points** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level 0** | Utilizing Customized System Messages as Utility Functions | Inspired by the patterns in the 'fabric' repo by Daniel Miessler | Provide more concrete examples for Research FocusedExamples, including benefits and challenges encountered |
| **Level 1** | Semantic Data Structures or LLM-Primitives | Using LLMs + structured outputs + your own customizations to build research components (Facts, Evidence, Q&A) | Emphasize human-LLM collaboration, potential biases, limitations, and ways to address them; Use interactive elements like quizzes/exercises |
| **Level 2** | Day-to-day Useful Agents Workflows (if we have time) | Clearly define the scope of Level 2 to help participants understand what can be achieved at this level | Emphasize human-LLM collaboration, potential biases, limitations, and ways to address them |
| **Extra Stuff** | cool ideas | Consider adding a 'bonus' section for advanced topics like creative writing or generating code | LLM CLI, Piping LLM inputs and outputs, Research Focused Examples

**Additional Notes**
| **Point** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Not interested in workflows that offload work completely to LLMs | Focus on using LLMs atomically to make you better at sub-tasks, augmenting capabilities and liberating intrinsic cognitive load rather than replacing effort.
